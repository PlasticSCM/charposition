# charposition
Small Windows app that renders a source file and shows the lines, columns and the number of each character in the file

![Char position counting chars on a file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlasticSCM/charposition/master/screenshot/charpositionscreenshot.png)

This app is useful to understand how SemanticMerge/Plastic SCM external parsers work.

While learning how to develop external parsers you probably create a parser by hand. Then you need to "count" the chars where declarations (methods, namespaces, classes, includes) start and end. This is painful. This app helps you in the process.

## How to use it
If you run the app without params, it displays a sample file.

Most likely what you want to do is to pass the file you want to display as argument:

charposition.exe Program.cs
